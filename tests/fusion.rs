//! Correction-following must not depend on how much context the planner admits.
//!
//! It used to. Seeding excluded evidence whose every live dependent had been
//! superseded — it still carries the old value verbatim, and a matcher that
//! ignores notes answers from it — but `expand` re-admitted exactly those nodes
//! through a dependency edge. A guard on one entrance of a room with two doors.
//!
//! It surfaced by accident. Raising `seed_min_ratio` from 0.3 to 0.5 cut the
//! working set from 461.9 tokens to 145.1 with all seven standard probes still
//! passing, which looked like a free 3x saving; on the adversarial mutation set
//! the same change served the superseded value on 3 of 4 queries. The threshold
//! was never the cause — it changed which nodes seeded, which changed which
//! expansions ran, and let the excluded node in through the second door.
//!
//! `expand` now applies the same rule `seed` does, and the tests below pin the
//! property and its control separately.
