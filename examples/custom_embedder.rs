//! Swapping the vector channel for your own embedder.
//!
//! The bundled embedder is a 256-dimensional hashing embedding: offline,
//! deterministic, dependency-free, and it finds material that shares
//! vocabulary. That last property is why paraphrase retrieval is a documented
//! poor fit — `cargo run --release -- bench --channels` measures how much it
//! actually agrees with the lexical channel instead of leaving it asserted.
//!
//! Replacing it is a constructor argument. Implement `Embedder`, put it on the
//! `Ladder`, and every vector the runtime builds — node L2 vectors and query
//! vectors alike — comes from yours.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo run --release --example custom_embedder`
